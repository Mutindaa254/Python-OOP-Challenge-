# 🐶🐾 Digital Pet – Python OOP Challenge

Welcome to this Digital Pet project! This was built as part of a fun Object-Oriented Programming challenge using Python 🐍. The goal was to design a virtual pet that you can feed, play with, and train—all using class-based programming.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice Python OOP concepts (classes, methods, constructors)
- Create and manage a pet with dynamic behavior
- Bonus: Teach the pet tricks and list them!

---

## 🐶 Features

✅ Attributes:
- `name`: Name of your digital pet
- `hunger`: Hunger level (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
- `energy`: Energy level (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
- `happiness`: Mood level (0 = sad, 10 = very happy)

✅ Actions:
- `.eat()` 🍖 – Reduces hunger and increases happiness
- `.sleep()` 😴 – Restores energy
- `.play()` 🎾 – Uses energy, boosts happiness, increases hunger
- `.get_status()` 📊 – View current stats
- `.train(trick)` 🧠 – Teach a new trick
- `.show_tricks()` 🎩 – Display learned tricks
